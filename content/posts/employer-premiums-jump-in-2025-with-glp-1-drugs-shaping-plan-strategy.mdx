# Employer Premiums Jump in 2025, With GLP-1 Drugs Shaping Plan Strategy

> KFF reports another premium climb for employer coverage in 2025 and spotlights GLP-1 weight-loss/diabetes drugs as a major cost driver that’s reshaping plan design.

**What’s new for 2025**
Employer health premiums are rising again in 2025, and a fast-growing class of weight-loss and diabetes medicines—GLP-1s—is a central reason plans are rethinking coverage rules, clinical programs, and stop-loss protection. The latest KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey reports average annual family premiums for employer coverage rose 6% in 2025 to nearly $27,000, with workers contributing about $6,850 of that amount from their paychecks [1]. News coverage of the survey underscores the continued cost pressure on employer plans and employees alike [2].

**Why GLP-1s are shaping the conversation**
GLP-1 receptor agonists (for example, semaglutide and tirzepatide) treat type 2 diabetes and, at specific doses or brand formulations, chronic weight management. Uptake has surged, contributing meaningful pharmacy spend growth for plans and employers. Recent analyses show GLP-1 use and spending climbed rapidly in the U.S., reflecting strong demand and expanding clinical indications [4]. In 2024, the FDA broadened semaglutide’s weight-management indication (Wegovy) to include reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in certain adults with established cardiovascular disease and obesity or overweight, potentially enlarging the eligible population for coverage [5]. Independent value assessments have found GLP-1s can deliver substantial clinical benefits, while also highlighting questions about long-term affordability and value at current net prices—issues employers must navigate in benefit design [7].

KFF flags these medications as a key driver behind plan changes in 2025, as employers weigh both near-term pharmacy costs and longer-term health outcomes that may reduce complications tied to diabetes and obesity [1]. Reports from employer and insurer groups similarly show that coverage is widespread but often paired with utilization management to balance access, outcomes, and budget impact [8].

**How big is the 2025 premium increase?**
- Average annual family premiums rose 6% in 2025, nearing $27,000 per family [1].
- Workers’ average contributions toward family premiums reached about $6,850 [1].
- The 2025 increase follows sustained cost pressure, with reporting noting employers continue to face higher medical and pharmacy costs that feed into premium setting [2].

While the exact ripple effects on every group will vary by region, workforce health status, and plan type, the headline is consistent: employers and employees are paying more in 2025, and a meaningful share of the discussion centers on high-cost drug utilization, including GLP-1s [1][2].

**What employers are doing about GLP-1s**
Employers are not simply saying yes or no to coverage—they’re refining how and when members can access these drugs and what support surrounds their use.

Coverage criteria and guardrails
- Prior authorization and clinical criteria: Many plans require meeting clinical thresholds (e.g., BMI and comorbidity criteria for weight management) and documentation of need or contraindications, aligning access with evidence-based use [3][8].
- Step therapy and program requirements: Some plans ask members to engage in lifestyle interventions or try other therapies first, then step up to GLP-1s if appropriate, reflecting common utilization management patterns for costly therapies [3][8].
- Duration or dollar caps: Employers may set time-limited coverage (for example, an initial 3–6 months with defined clinical checkpoints) or budget caps, often linked to outcomes monitoring to verify continued benefit [3][9].

Clinical programs and centers of excellence
- Integrated care models: Employers are pairing medications with nutrition counseling, behavioral health support, and condition management to improve persistence and outcomes and reduce discontinuation-related weight regain [9].
- Centers of excellence: Some purchasers steer members to high-quality obesity care programs that coordinate medical, nutritional, and behavioral services to support durable results [9].

Formulary and contracting levers
- Formulary preference: Plans may prefer specific GLP-1s based on negotiated net cost, evidence, and dosing convenience, using tiering or exclusions to manage spend [3][8].
- Outcomes-based approaches: Purchasers and payers are exploring outcomes-based contracts where net payment reflects real-world performance (for example, agreed-on weight loss or cardiometabolic outcomes), a model consistent with value frameworks urged by independent review bodies [7][9].

Stop-loss and risk protection
- Stop-loss carriers are closely tracking high-cost drug trends. Recent stop-loss research highlights rising impacts from specialty therapies and metabolic conditions; employers may see tighter underwriting, lasers, or premium adjustments in response to persistent high-cost categories [6]. The growth of GLP-1 use is part of this broader specialty-spend dynamic that informs stop-loss pricing and risk terms [6].

**Member experience vs. cost containment: the trade-offs**
Employers are trying to manage both affordability and access, and choices here have real impacts on people.

Access and adherence
- Tight prior authorization or step therapy can slow time to therapy and increase administrative burden for members and clinicians, potentially affecting uptake and adherence [8].
- Pairing drugs with coaching and nutrition support may improve persistence and outcomes, especially given that weight often returns when therapy stops abruptly, which can undermine value if use is inconsistent [9][7].

Clinical benefits and value
- For individuals with obesity or overweight and established cardiovascular disease, semaglutide’s expanded indication to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events represents a significant potential health benefit, which may strengthen the case for coverage in targeted populations [5].
- Independent reviews conclude these medicines deliver meaningful weight loss and metabolic improvements; however, at current prices and likely broad demand, careful targeting and contracting are key to ensuring sustainable value for plan sponsors [7].

Equity considerations
- Eligibility rules that require documented program participation or frequent check-ins can inadvertently disadvantage members with limited time, transportation, or digital access. Employers aiming for equitable access often build flexible pathways and offer remote options to minimize barriers [9].

Communication and trust
- When employees understand why rules exist and how to navigate them, frustration drops. Clear timelines for prior authorization decisions, simple checklists for required documentation, and proactive outreach reduce confusion and appeals [10].

**Five practical steps for brokers and HR teams**
1) Quantify your baseline and trajectory
- Analyze current and projected GLP-1 utilization, indication mix (diabetes vs. weight management), discontinuation rates, and net cost trends. Market data show demand growth has been strong; local experience can differ, so use your claims data and PBM reports to calibrate forecasts [4].
- Model premium impact scenarios under alternative coverage criteria (e.g., restricting to high-risk cohorts, layering outcomes programs), and reflect stop-loss terms to see the full risk picture [6].

2) Tighten clinical criteria—then test ease of use
- Align criteria with evidence and regulatory indications, including cardiometabolic risk targeting where benefits are clearest [5][7].
- Pressure-test the member journey: How many steps, portals, and signatures are required? Aim for the minimum necessary to assure appropriate use without excessive friction [8][10].

3) Pair meds with comprehensive support
- Bundle medication access with nutrition, behavioral health, sleep, and physical activity programs, ideally through integrated vendors or centers of excellence, to improve adherence and outcomes [9].
- Consider time-bound trials with defined outcome checkpoints (e.g., percentage weight loss at 3 and 6 months) to continue coverage when members benefit and reroute when they do not [3][9].

4) Use contracting and formulary levers thoughtfully
- Work with PBMs on preferred agents based on net price and outcomes data. Explore outcomes-based agreements where available and administratively feasible [7][9].
- Review compound and off-label policies to ensure safety and cost oversight, and keep an eye on pipeline shifts that could alter relative value across agents [3][4].

5) Communicate early, simply, and often
- Provide plain-language summaries, FAQs, and comparison charts before open enrollment. Use multiple channels—email, meetings, intranet—to reach different audiences and reinforce key points [10].
- Train managers and benefits navigators to answer sensitive questions without stigma and to refer employees to clinical programs and financial assistance resources as appropriate [9][10].

**What to watch next**
- Indication expansion and evidence: As clinical evidence evolves—such as cardiovascular outcomes and real-world adherence—expect employers to refine targeting where benefits are greatest [5][7].
- Utilization and affordability: Broader demand remains plausible given strong public interest and clinical promise; utilization trends will continue to influence premium setting and stop-loss underwriting [4][6].
- Vendor innovation: Look for more integrated condition-management programs, remote monitoring, and outcomes-based pilots aimed at improving value and smoothing member experience [9].

The bottom line: Premiums are up again in 2025, and GLP-1 therapies are prompting employers to recalibrate coverage, contracting, and support programs. Plans that combine smart clinical criteria with robust member support and transparent communication can better balance cost control with meaningful access—improving the odds that dollars spent translate into healthier members and more predictable budgets [1][2][3][9].
