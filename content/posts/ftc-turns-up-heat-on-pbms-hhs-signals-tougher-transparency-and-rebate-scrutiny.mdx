# FTC Turns Up Heat on PBMs; HHS Signals Tougher Transparency and Rebate Scrutiny

> What plan sponsors should do now: revisit PBM contract clauses, weigh alternative pricing models, consider specialty carve-outs carefully, and track litigation and rulemaking timelines.

**What’s new, and why it matters**
The Federal Trade Commission’s ongoing deep dive into pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) has amplified concerns about market power, steering to affiliated pharmacies, and spread pricing—issues that can raise employer and member costs and narrow pharmacy access [1]. At the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its operating divisions have pushed complementary transparency measures in Medicare and employer plans, including eliminating retroactive pharmacy DIR fees in Part D and requiring detailed prescription drug and rebate reporting from group health plans—signals that rebate and pricing practices will face more scrutiny ahead [2][7]. Together, these developments point to a 2025–26 window where contract terms, pricing models, and specialty strategies will be under a brighter regulatory spotlight.

For employers and union plan sponsors, the immediate takeaway is practical: get ahead of scrutiny by tightening PBM contracts, demanding usable data, and re-evaluating pricing models and specialty carve-outs. The goal is to align incentives with lower net costs and better member access while staying compliant with evolving federal and state rules [4][6].

**What the FTC has been flagging**
The FTC’s multi-year 6(b) inquiry into the six largest PBMs examines how consolidation, vertically integrated ownership, reimbursement methodologies, and contractual practices affect independent pharmacies, plan sponsors, and patients. Concerns include:
- Potential steering to PBM-affiliated pharmacies and specialty entities, which may disadvantage independents and reduce member choice [1].
- Spread pricing—where PBMs charge plans more than they reimburse pharmacies for the same prescription—has drawn particular attention as a source of opacity and misaligned incentives, especially in managed care contexts [1][5].
- Information asymmetries that limit employers’ ability to audit or compare true net prices after rebates, fees, and price concessions [1][4].

While the FTC’s process can culminate in recommendations and enforcement, the agency’s findings are already influencing purchaser expectations and parallel policy moves at HHS and in state legislatures [1][6].

**HHS moves: transparency and rebates**
Recent HHS actions underscore transparency and rebate scrutiny:
- In Medicare Part D, CMS ended the practice of applying most pharmacy price concessions as retroactive DIR fees and instead requires those concessions to be reflected at the point of sale, improving price transparency for beneficiaries and pharmacies beginning in 2024 [2].
- For employer and union plans, federal regulators require annual Prescription Drug Data Collection (RxDC), capturing spending, utilization, and rebates/fees—giving agencies a line of sight into PBM economics in group health markets [7].
- Gag clause prohibitions and annual attestations now apply to group health plans and issuers, curbing contract terms that block price and quality transparency—often relevant to PBM agreements and data access [3].

These steps don’t set a single national PBM pricing standard. But they do expand visibility into the flows of money and discounts—raising the bar for documentation, reporting accuracy, and clean data rights in employer contracts [2][3][7].

**Contract clauses employers should revisit now**
Tight, auditable contracts can help sponsors align incentives and withstand regulatory scrutiny. Consider the following provisions when negotiating or amending your PBM agreement:
- Definitions and revenue: Precisely define “rebates,” “admin fees,” “price concessions,” “copay assistance,” and “clinical program fees.” Require a comprehensive list of all PBM revenue sources tied to your plan and how each is treated in guarantees (kept by PBM vs. passed through) [4].
- Pass-through on manufacturer monies: Specify 100% pass-through of manufacturer rebates and fees, timing of payments, and clear audit rights—plus visibility into how formulary placement decisions relate to those dollars [4].
- Ingredient cost methodology and MAC transparency: Spell out the exact reimbursement benchmarks (e.g., NADAC, WAC, AWP) and how Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) lists are built, updated, and appealed. Consider transparent MAC with time-bound appeal resolution and auditability [9][4].
- Spread pricing prohibition: If using a pass-through model, explicitly bar spread pricing and define dispensing fee structures and administrative fee caps to avoid “fee migration” into other categories [5][4].
- Network and steering: Limit any mandatory use of PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies unless there is demonstrable net cost/value. Require notice and your consent for network changes that affect member access or independent pharmacies [1][4].
- Specialty definitions and channeling: Nail down what counts as “specialty,” permissible site-of-care management, and any white/brown-bagging rules. Ensure any specialty channeling is supported by net savings and quality data, not merely ownership [1][4].
- Data rights and audit: Codify your rights to claims-level data, rebate and fee remittances, MAC lists, and network economics. Gag clause prohibitions apply broadly—ensure they are honored and your annual attestation is supported by the contract’s language [3][7].
- Formulary governance and exclusions: Require clinical and financial rationales for exclusions, tie value assessments to net cost, and allow employer veto for high-impact classes (e.g., insulin, oncology) to balance savings with member stability [4].
- Service levels and remedies: Set measurable service metrics (call centers, prior auth turnarounds, appeal times) and financial remedies for non-performance, including for pharmacy payment timeliness post-DIR reform [2].

**Alternative pharmacy contracting models to consider**
No single pricing model fits every population; trade-offs are real. Common approaches include:
- Pass-through with fixed admin fee: The PBM passes all ingredient cost, dispensing fee, and manufacturer monies through at cost and charges a transparent per-claim or per-member admin fee. Pros: aligns incentives, simplifies audits; Cons: requires strong data discipline and may shift volatility to the plan [4][5].
- Transparent MAC and NADAC-based reimbursement: Tether generics to publicly available benchmarks like NADAC with clear, timely appeals, plus a disclosed professional fee. Pros: reduces pricing opacity and disputes; Cons: pharmacies may resist if fees aren’t calibrated to acquisition cost trends [9][5].
- Reference-based or network-differentiated contracts: Tier networks and reimburse differently by pharmacy type, trading narrower networks for better rates. Pros: potential savings; Cons: member disruption and access concerns, especially in rural areas [1][4].
- Value-linked arrangements: Tie fees or performance bonuses to adherence, outcomes, or total-cost metrics. Pros: focuses on clinical value; Cons: measurement and data-sharing complexity [4].

Employers using any model should make sure pharmacy price concessions flow to the point of sale where appropriate (to avoid downstream distortions) and confirm guarantees are net of all fees with robust audit rights, especially amid the post-DIR transition in Part D and spillover practices in commercial plans [2][4].

**Specialty carve-outs: proceed, but with eyes open**
Specialty drugs account for a disproportionate share of total drug spend, making carve-outs attractive—but complex. Independent research shows specialty medicines now represent roughly half of U.S. drug spending, despite serving a small fraction of patients, concentrating risk and administrative scrutiny in this category [8]. If you consider a carve-out:
- Verify net-of-rebate value: Require line-of-sight to both pharmacy and medical benefit specialty spend (buy-and-bill, infusion centers) and insist on total-cost analytics, not unit price alone [4][8].
- Align distribution and site-of-care: If steering to specific specialty pharmacies or sites, demand evidence of lower net cost and equivalent or better outcomes and access. Otherwise, consider a broader network with standardized fees and transparent acquisition cost references (e.g., NADAC where feasible) [9][4].
- Watch compliance and member impact: Some “alternative funding” schemes or copay optimization programs can create compliance or continuity-of-care risks if manufacturer assistance lapses or plan exclusions are aggressive. Require legal review, patient protections, and opt-out rights [4].
- Integrate with medical management: Specialty benefit carve-outs should dovetail with prior authorization, case management, and oncology/cell and gene therapy strategies to avoid cost-shifting or therapy delays [4][8].

State rules may constrain specialty channeling and reimbursement methodologies; contracting flexibility can vary by carrier, network, and geography. Plan counsel should review state PBM laws and any network adequacy or any willing provider requirements before finalizing a carve-out [6].

**Regulatory and litigation timelines to watch**
- FTC PBM inquiry: The FTC’s 6(b) study launched in 2022 continues; additional public reporting and potential enforcement or policy recommendations may follow. Expect ongoing focus on steering, spread pricing, and vertical integration [1].
- Part D pharmacy price concessions: The reclassification of pharmacy DIR to point-of-sale is in effect. Plans and PBMs should monitor cash-flow, pharmacy payment timing, and member cost-sharing effects through 2025 plan designs [2].
- Employer RxDC reporting: RxDC is annual and evolving. Ensure you and your PBM align on data quality, governance, and attestations, including a clear division of reporting responsibilities and data validation [7].
- Gag clause attestation: Annual gag clause attestations are required; review PBM and carrier agreements to remove or override any conflicting confidentiality provisions [3].
- State PBM statutes and litigation: The Supreme Court’s Rutledge decision affirmed that ERISA does not categorically preempt certain state PBM regulations, empowering states to regulate PBM reimbursement methods and appeals. Expect continued state activity and case-by-case litigation shaping what is allowed in each jurisdiction [6].

**Action checklist for the next 90 days**
- Pull your PBM contract and mark up: definitions, revenue treatment, audit rights, MAC transparency, steering controls, specialty terms, and service metrics [4][5].
- Align on a pricing model: Decide whether to pursue pass-through with fixed fees, transparent MAC, or a hybrid—and model the impact on total cost and network adequacy [4][9].
- Lock in data rights: Ensure access to claims-level files, rebate remittances, MAC lists, network economics, and clinical program outcomes that support RxDC and gag clause compliance [3][7].
- Stress-test specialty: Build a cross-benefit (pharmacy and medical) view; test carve-out scenarios against member access, total cost, and compliance risks [8][4].
- Calendar compliance: Set reminders for RxDC and gag clause attestations, and require your PBM to supply supporting data and certifications on a set schedule [3][7].

The common thread: demand clarity. As federal and state scrutiny intensifies, contracts that clearly define revenue, pass through price concessions, and enable verification are better positioned to deliver real savings—and withstand audits.
