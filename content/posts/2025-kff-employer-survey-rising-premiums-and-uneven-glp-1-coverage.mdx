# 2025 KFF Employer Survey: Rising Premiums and Uneven GLP-1 Coverage

> The 2025 KFF Employer Survey reveals a 6% increase in family premiums and mixed coverage for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs among employers.

**Rising Premiums**  
According to the 2025 KFF Employer Survey, average family premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance have risen by 6%, reaching approximately $27,000.  
  
- **Employee Contribution**: Workers are now contributing about $6,850 toward these premiums, which reflects a growing financial burden on employees.  
- **Historical Context**: This increase continues a trend of rising healthcare costs, which have outpaced wage growth in recent years [1].  
  
**GLP-1 Coverage Expansion**  
Coverage for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, such as semaglutide and liraglutide, is expanding among large employers but remains inconsistent across the board.  
  
- **Large Employers**: Many large companies are beginning to include these high-cost medications in their health plans, reflecting a shift in attitudes toward obesity treatment.  
- **Mixed Results**: However, overall coverage rates are still mixed, with some employers hesitant due to return on investment (ROI) concerns, despite increasing utilization of these drugs [2].  
  
**Trade-offs and Variations**  
The decision to cover GLP-1 medications varies significantly by state and employer.  
  
- **State Variations**: Some states have more robust healthcare regulations that may encourage broader coverage.  
- **Employer Discretion**: Employers must weigh the potential benefits of covering these drugs against the costs, leading to a patchwork of coverage options across the country.  
  
**Conclusion**  
As healthcare costs continue to rise, employers face tough decisions regarding premium contributions and the inclusion of new treatments like GLP-1 medications. Stakeholders must navigate these complexities to ensure both employee health and financial sustainability.
