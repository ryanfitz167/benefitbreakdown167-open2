**Quick take:** Employers want smarter care navigation, targeted pharmacy management, and stronger engagement—without cutting value.

## Care Navigation That Actually Navigates
Buyers want a *single front door* that helps members pick the right site of care, compare costs, and book quickly—paired with **live handoffs**.

## Pharmacy Guardrails
GLP-1 demand stays high while specialty spend creeps up. Tighten **clinical criteria, step therapy, and outcomes contracts**.

## Mental Health Access
Hybrid models—virtual first, local backup—measured by **time-to-care** and outcomes.

## MSK + Metabolic Programs
Focus on **function improvement** and **surgical avoidance**.

## Member Experience as Savings
Click friction = waste. Standardize **brand, navigation, messaging**; run quarterly engagement campaigns with one KPI.

## Price Transparency With Teeth
Easier comparisons, **preferred providers**, and incentives for high-value choices.
