# Telehealth’s 2025 Cliff: What Expires, What Stays, and How Plans Are Preparing

> Key Medicare telehealth flexibilities are scheduled to lapse at year-end 2025, prompting a practical “fall 2025” decision point as Medicare Advantage, employers, and regulators lock in 2026 benefits.

**Why this matters now**
- Many pandemic-era telehealth flexibilities under Medicare are time-limited and slated to expire December 31, 2025 unless Congress acts, while DEA’s temporary rules for prescribing certain controlled medications via telemedicine also sunset at the end of 2025 [1][3].
- Because Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D benefits are finalized months in advance (bids generally due the first Monday in June of the prior year), stakeholders warn of a practical “fall 2025” decision point: 2026 benefit designs must assume current law unless an extension or permanent policy is enacted, influencing what plans market during the October 2025 open enrollment season [5].

Below is a plain-English guide to what actually expires, what continues, and what it means for mental health, rural care, cross-state practice, and employer coverage as plans build their 2026 offerings.

**What’s scheduled to expire under Medicare at year-end 2025**
- Patient’s home and non-rural locations as “originating sites.” During the pandemic, Congress suspended Medicare’s long-standing geographic restrictions (rural-only) and site limits (clinic-based) for telehealth. Current law continues most of these waivers through December 31, 2025, allowing beneficiaries to receive telehealth from home and urban areas; absent legislation, the pre-pandemic rural and facility-based rules would resume January 1, 2026 [1].
- Expanded list of eligible telehealth practitioners and services. Statutory and CMS actions temporarily allow additional clinicians (for example, physical/occupational therapists) and a broader set of services to be furnished via telehealth; many of these additions are tied to the 2025 calendar year under CMS’s Category 3 telehealth list and related policies [2].
- FQHCs and RHCs acting as distant sites. Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics may serve as distant-site telehealth providers under temporary authority through 2025; this authority would end without further action [1].
- Audio-only for some services beyond behavioral health. CMS expanded audio-only allowances during the emergency and sustained limited audio-only use under temporary authorities; some non-mental-health audio-only flexibility is slated to sunset with other telehealth extensions at the end of 2025 [1][2].
- Telemental health in-person visit deferral. Congress permanently allowed Medicare coverage of telemental health for patients at home, but conditioned it on an in-person visit (within 6 months before the telehealth service and periodically thereafter). Enforcement of that in-person requirement has been delayed until January 1, 2026; without further delay or reform, the in-person rule takes effect in 2026 [1].

**What continues beyond 2025 under current law**
- Core, pre-pandemic telehealth rules remain. Even if temporary flexibilities expire, Medicare still covers telehealth under Section 1834(m) for certain services, originating sites, and in rural areas; the emergency-era expansions would simply roll back to the narrower pre-2020 framework [1].
- Some behavioral health flexibilities are permanent. Congress permanently authorized coverage of telemental health for patients in their home (subject to the in-person requirement resuming in 2026), and CMS finalized conditions under which audio-only telemental health is permissible when the beneficiary cannot use video technology, with documentation requirements that continue under permanent mental health policy [1][2].

**Separate but related: DEA tele-prescribing flexibilities end in 2025**
- The Drug Enforcement Administration, with HHS, issued a second temporary rule extending COVID-19 telemedicine flexibilities for prescribing certain controlled substances without an initial in-person exam through December 31, 2025 while it crafts a permanent standard. After that date, absent a final rule, prescribers would generally need an in-person exam or to meet a specific telemedicine exception to initiate controlled-substance therapy via telehealth [3].

**Why fall 2025 feels like a cliff**
- Medicare Advantage and Part D bid calendars drive earlier decisions. MA and Part D plans must submit bids for the following plan year in early June, using policies in effect or reasonably expected to be in effect; benefit packages and networks are set months before the October 15 annual enrollment period. If Congress has not extended telehealth flexibilities by mid-2025, most 2026 plan designs will assume reversion to narrower Medicare rules, which then shape the options consumers see during fall 2025 marketing and selection [5].

**Implications for mental health access**
- Reliance remains high. Behavioral health accounted for a substantial share of Medicare telehealth during and after the pandemic, especially for psychotherapy and substance use disorder treatment, which saw large shifts to virtual modalities [4]. Abruptly reimposing an in-person precondition in 2026 could disrupt continuity of care, particularly for homebound, mobility-limited, or rural beneficiaries [1][4].
- Audio-only bridges digital divides. Allowances for audio-only telemental health have helped patients who lack broadband or video-capable devices. If broader audio-only policies sunset while the in-person requirement resumes, clinicians may face more complex triage decisions for patients who cannot connect by video and have limited local options [1][2][4].
- Program integrity and quality concerns persist. Oversight agencies have urged balancing access with safeguards; GAO has highlighted the need for better data and targeted monitoring to mitigate fraud and ensure quality without bluntly curtailing legitimate telehealth use [4].

**Implications for rural beneficiaries and facility stability**
- Access gains at risk. Temporary removal of geographic and originating-site limits made specialty consultations and follow-up care more accessible for rural Medicare beneficiaries. Allowing FQHCs and RHCs to serve as distant-site providers enabled local systems to keep revenue and manage care virtually. Rolling back these flexibilities could reduce timely access and stress rural providers already facing staffing shortages [1][4].
- Broadband gaps still matter. While many rural patients benefited from video visits, persistent broadband gaps mean audio-only options remain important for equitable access. Policymakers’ choices on audio-only coverage will shape rural telehealth’s staying power [4].

**Cross-state practice: no federal preemption, state compacts help**
- Licensure is a state call. With federal PHE waivers long expired, clinicians must hold appropriate state licenses to provide telehealth to patients in the state where the patient is located, unless a state-specific exception applies. Most states participate in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, which can streamline—but not replace—licensure in multiple states, aiding multi-state telehealth practices and large platforms [6].
- Variation is the norm. Requirements for telehealth consent, modality, supervision, and prescribing vary by state, complicating multi-state practice and potentially affecting provider supply for national telehealth networks in 2026 [6].

**Employer and commercial coverage: parity and pre-deductible rules**
- State telehealth parity laws mostly target fully insured plans. Many states require commercial insurers to cover telehealth services if the same service is covered in-person (coverage parity), and some require payment parity (same pay for the same service regardless of modality). Because ERISA preempts most state insurance mandates for self-funded employer plans, parity laws typically do not bind large self-funded employers, who set their own telehealth coverage terms [7].
- HDHP/HSA “telehealth safe harbor” extended for 2025 and 2026 plan years. Congress reauthorized the CARES Act’s safe harbor allowing high-deductible health plans to cover telehealth pre-deductible without jeopardizing HSA eligibility for plan years beginning in 2025 and 2026, reducing a key barrier to first-dollar virtual care in employer plans during that window [1].
- What employers are offering. Telemedicine is now nearly universal among large employers; KFF reports that the vast majority of large firms offer telemedicine benefits, often for behavioral health. Employers are also piloting or scaling “virtual primary care” models that assign members to a digital-first primary team, with in-person networks for labs and procedures [8][9].

**How plans are likely to treat virtual primary care in 2026 designs**
- If Congress extends Medicare flexibilities: Expect MA plans to continue marketing virtual-first options, leveraging home as an originating site and broad provider types, with continued tele-behavioral integration. Commercial and employer plans would likely maintain low or no cost-sharing for virtual primary care, backed by the HDHP/HSA safe harbor through 2026 plan years, and may add care navigation and remote monitoring bundles where evidence and network capacity support it [1][2][8][9].
- If flexibilities lapse on January 1, 2026: MA plans would need to align with narrower originating-site and geographic rules, potentially curtailing at-home video visits except for mental health. Expect more stringent eligibility screening for telehealth benefits, narrower virtual provider panels, and a shift toward hybrid models emphasizing in-person visits for conditions CMS limits via telehealth. Employers may keep virtual primary care but adjust cost-sharing, utilization management, and steerage to in-person networks for services that lose favorable coverage under Medicare benchmarks or encounter licensing barriers in key states [1][2][5][7].
- Behavioral health remains a priority. Regardless of Congressional action, plans are likely to protect virtual behavioral health access given sustained demand and network gaps; however, the 2026 resumption of Medicare’s in-person prerequisite for telemental health would require workflow changes and more hybrid options for seniors unless Congress revises or further delays the policy [1][2][4].

**Trade-offs policymakers are weighing**
- Access and equity vs. cost and integrity. Proponents argue that making telehealth expansions permanent supports access, chronic disease management, and patient preference, with particular gains in behavioral health and rural care. Skeptics worry about increased utilization and spending if guardrails are loosened, and call for targeted program-integrity tools, modality-appropriate quality standards, and data collection to prevent fraud without undermining legitimate care [1][2][4].
- Permanence vs. time-limited extensions. Congress could lock in major Medicare telehealth changes (ending geographic restrictions, allowing home as an originating site, and retaining broader practitioner eligibility), or opt for another short-term extension to gather more evidence. Each approach affects how 2026 plans are designed in 2025, with short extensions perpetuating uncertainty for MA organizations, employer plan sponsors, and providers [1][2][5].

**What to watch next**
- Legislative proposals. Bills such as the CONNECT for Health Act and other telehealth extension packages would codify or extend pandemic-era flexibilities. Watch for whether Congress addresses the 2026 telemental health in-person requirement, FQHC/RHC distant-site authority, audio-only coverage, and data/guardrail provisions [1][2].
- DEA’s final rulemaking. A permanent telemedicine standard for prescribing controlled substances will shape virtual addiction treatment and some psychiatric care after December 31, 2025 [3].
- State actions. Licensing compacts may expand, and states may refine coverage or payment parity rules—particularly for mental health—affecting multi-state telehealth models in employer and individual markets [6][7].

Bottom line: The legal cliff is year-end 2025—but the practical cliff is fall 2025, when 2026 benefits must be locked in. Clear federal direction this year would help MA plans, employers, and providers design sustainable virtual care that balances access, quality, and program integrity [1][2][5].
