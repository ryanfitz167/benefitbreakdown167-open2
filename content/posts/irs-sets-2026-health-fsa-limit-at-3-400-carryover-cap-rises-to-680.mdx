# IRS Sets 2026 Health FSA Limit at $3,400; Carryover Cap Rises to $680

> Employers should update election caps, carryover rules, and plan documents now to reflect the 2026 Health FSA limits and ensure smooth administration across 2025→2026 and 2026→2027 plan years.

**What changed for 2026**

The IRS has set the 2026 health flexible spending arrangement (FSA) salary-reduction limit at $3,400 for plan years beginning in 2026—an increase of $100 from the prior year’s cap of $3,300 for 2025 plan years [1], [2]. Because the carryover limit equals 20% of the annual salary-reduction maximum under IRS rules, the carryover ceiling tied to the 2026 cap is $680, up from $660 in 2025 [1], [3], [4]. These amounts apply to health FSAs under Section 125 cafeteria plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2026 (or other start dates in 2026 for non-calendar plan years) [1].

- 2026 health FSA salary-reduction limit: $3,400 [1], [3]
- 2026 maximum carryover (if offered): $680 (20% of $3,400) [1], [4]
- 2025 figures for reference: $3,300 limit; $660 carryover [2], [4]

Employers are not required to allow carryovers, but if they do, the plan document must authorize it, and the carryover ceiling is determined by the IRS formula (20% of the current-year FSA salary-reduction limit) [4].

**Why the carryover went up**

The carryover amount is set by a standing IRS rule—originally established in IRS Notice 2020-33—that ties the carryover maximum to 20% of the indexed salary-reduction limit for the applicable year [4]. When the underlying FSA salary-reduction limit increases (as it did for 2026), the carryover amount increases proportionally [1], [3], [4]. For 2026 plan years, that math yields a carryover ceiling of $680 (0.20 × $3,400) [1], [4].

This formula is distinct from temporary COVID-era relief that allowed expanded carryovers and extended grace periods; those temporary provisions have expired, and the standard 20% carryover framework applies for 2025 and 2026 plan years unless Congress or the IRS enacts new relief [4].

**Key employer actions to take now**

To stay compliant and reduce participant confusion ahead of open enrollment, plan sponsors should:

- Align the plan’s election cap with the new 2026 limit. Update the annual maximum to $3,400 in enrollment systems, payroll deduction tables, and administrative platforms for plan years beginning in 2026 [1], [3]. If your plan intentionally sets a lower cap, confirm the chosen maximum and communicate clearly to employees [1].
- Confirm carryover parameters. If your plan allows carryovers, ensure administrators and recordkeepers are applying the correct ceilings in both directions: $660 for unused 2025 balances carried into 2026, and $680 for unused 2026 balances carried into 2027 [2], [3], [4].
- Update plan documents and SPD/SMM. The Summary Plan Description must accurately reflect eligibility, limits, and how the carryover (if any) works; if you’re changing limits or features, issue a Summary of Material Modifications (SMM) and update the SPD consistent with ERISA’s content requirements [5].
- Refresh employee communications. Revise benefit guides, enrollment pages, and decision-support tools to show the $3,400 cap and explain how the $680 carryover works for 2026 plan years [1], [3], [5].
- Recalibrate dependent status and HSA compatibility messaging. If you offer limited-purpose (dental/vision) FSAs to support HSA eligibility, make sure carryover communications clarify how balances are treated across plan years to avoid jeopardizing HSA contributions [4].

**Timing and effective dates**

The new health FSA limit applies to plan years that begin in 2026. For calendar-year plans, that’s January 1, 2026; for off-calendar plans, it’s the first day of your 2026 plan year [1]. Carryover ceilings are tied to the year from which amounts are carried: unused 2025 balances carry up to $660 into 2026; unused 2026 balances carry up to $680 into 2027, if your plan offers carryover and the participant remains eligible [2], [3], [4].

- If your plan year begins January 1, 2026: maximum salary-reduction election is $3,400 for that plan year [1], [3].
- Carryover windows: 2025 to 2026 uses the $660 limit; 2026 to 2027 uses the $680 limit [2], [3], [4].

Make sure your enrollment materials and system edits reflect the year-specific carryover limits (many systems default to a single “current limit,” which can cause errors at year-end without manual configuration) [3], [4].

**How the carryover interacts with elections**

- The carryover isn’t an additional election—it’s the amount of unused funds a participant may bring forward, up to the cap, provided your plan allows carryovers [4].
- The carryover does not reduce the new year’s election; a participant may carry over up to the cap and still elect the full $3,400 for the 2026 plan year if your plan permits both a carryover and new elections up to the limit [1], [4].
- Carryover availability depends on remaining eligible coverage. Typically, the participant must enroll in the health FSA for the new plan year and satisfy any plan eligibility rules to access the carryover [4].

These rules are established in IRS guidance; employers can adopt stricter internal rules (like lower caps or eligibility conditions) so long as they remain consistent with IRS requirements and are properly documented and disclosed to participants [4], [5].

**Open enrollment and system readiness checklist**

To reduce errors during open enrollment and in January processing, work through this checklist:

- Payroll and HRIS
  - Update the max election field to $3,400 for plan years starting in 2026 [1], [3].
  - Confirm pre-tax deductions map to the correct Section 125 codes in payroll [1].
- TPA/Administrator
  - Validate the 2025→2026 carryover cap is set at $660 and the 2026→2027 cap at $680 [2], [3], [4].
  - Check run-out and substantiation rules so that 2025 claims are processed correctly while 2026 accounts open [4].
- Plan documents and communications
  - Amend plan documents if needed to adopt or continue carryover features, and align SPDs and SMMs with the new limits and features [4], [5].
  - Update OE guides, FAQs, intranet pages, and calculators to reflect the 2026 cap and carryover ceiling [1], [5].
- Employee experience
  - Train benefits call-center staff on the $3,400 limit and $680 carryover [1], [3].
  - Provide examples showing how much can carry from 2025 ($660) and from 2026 ($680) to reduce confusion [2], [4].

**Practical messaging tips for employees**

- Emphasize “use-it-or-keep-some” reality. Unused funds above the carryover limit are forfeited at year-end. Encourage employees to estimate conservatively, knowing up to $680 can carry from 2026 to 2027 if the plan allows [3], [4].
- Clarify run-out vs. carryover. A run-out period lets employees submit prior-year claims after year-end; carryover is about keeping unused funds for new-year expenses, up to the cap [4]. Make sure both concepts are explained distinctly in OE materials [5].
- Spotlight eligible expenses. Remind participants about common eligible items—copays, prescriptions, contact lenses—to help them plan contributions up to the $3,400 limit [1].

**Compliance notes and trade-offs**

- Carryover is optional and must be authorized in the plan document; the cap is formula-driven (20% of the limit) and adjusts automatically as the IRS updates the underlying salary-reduction maximum [4].
- Employers may set a lower plan maximum than the IRS limit if desired (e.g., to simplify administration), but the plan cap must be applied consistently and disclosed in the SPD [1], [5].
- Watch for alignment with other benefits. If you offer HSAs and limited-purpose FSAs, coordinate year-end and carryover rules to avoid inadvertently disqualifying employees from HSA contributions [4].

These decisions involve trade-offs: a higher plan cap gives employees more tax-advantaged room to budget for health expenses, while a conservative cap can reduce forfeitures and simplify communications. Likewise, offering a carryover can improve employee satisfaction and reduce waste, but it adds configuration complexity (especially when two consecutive carryover caps differ, as they will from 2025 to 2026 and 2026 to 2027) [2], [3], [4].

**Bottom line**

- Set the 2026 health FSA election cap at $3,400 for plan years beginning in 2026 [1], [3].
- If you offer a carryover, configure systems for $660 (2025→2026) and $680 (2026→2027) and make sure documentation and employee materials reflect both limits clearly [2], [3], [4].
- Update plan documents, SPDs/SMMs, and OE content so that what you promise participants matches how your administrators and payroll systems operate [5].

With the 2026 limits now set, proactive updates across plan design, systems, and communications will help employees get the full value of their FSAs—and help employers avoid year-end and new-year administration headaches [1], [3], [5].
