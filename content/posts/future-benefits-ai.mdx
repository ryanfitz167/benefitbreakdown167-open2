**Thesis:** The next wave in benefits is practical personalization—powered by AI, underpinned by price transparency, and measured by outcomes members can feel.

## AI for Navigation (Done Right)
Think triage and guidance, not medical advice. The key is **human-in-the-loop** escalation and plain-English explanations.

## Price Transparency → Trust
Members expect shoppable prices for imaging, labs, and common procedures. Highlight **preferred providers** and offer cash rewards.

## Personalized Benefits
- Smarter reminders (adherence, preventive care).  
- Condition bundles (MSK, maternity, metabolic) with **one team, one plan**.  
- Behavioral health across all journeys.

## Measurement That Matters
- Clinical outcomes (A1c, pain/function, readmissions) plus member effort scores.  
- Simple KPIs: **PCP attribution**, avoided ER visits, completed screenings.
