**Read time:** ~4 minutes. This isn’t legal advice—just a practical checklist HR can run each Q4/Q1.

## Core ACA Tasks

- **Employer Mandate (ALE):** Confirm ALE status and affordability safe harbor (W-2, rate of pay, or FPL). Recalculate after contribution or pay changes.
- **Minimum Value/Essential Coverage:** Validate plan designs meet MV/MEC. Keep carrier/actuarial attestations on file.
- **1094-C/1095-C:** Prep data early. Test with your vendor; scrub SSNs, dependents, and full-time status flags.

## Notices & Disclosures

- **SBCs:** Distribute on time with accurate deductibles, OOP max, and tier details.
- **HIPAA Special Enrollment:** Include timelines and contact info on all eligibility communications.
- **WHCRA, CHIPRA, Medicare Creditable Coverage:** Bundle in your open enrollment packet and maintain proof of delivery.

## Rx & Transparency Items

- **RxDC reporting:** Confirm roles with carrier/TPA and calendar key dates.
- **MRFs:** Validate vendor hosting and public link accessibility.
- **Price Comparison Tool:** Spot-check common shoppable services for accuracy.

## Operational Hygiene

- **Eligibility controls:** Run monthly audits on FT/PT status and COBRA events.
- **COBRA notices:** Time-box terminations and qualifying events.
- **Document retention:** Keep plan docs, SPDs, SBCs, notices, and filings for recommended periods.

## Quarterly Rhythm

1. **Q1:** File, reconcile 1095-Cs, close year-end eligibility gaps.  
2. **Q2:** Mid-year compliance spot check; test price tool links.  
3. **Q3:** OE readiness (plan changes, notices, eligibility rules).  
4. **Q4:** Final SBCs, updated contributions, vendor attestations.

*Takeaway:* Treat compliance like payroll—**repeatable, calendared, and auditable**.
