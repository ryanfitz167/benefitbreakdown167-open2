# IRS Sets 2026 HSA and HDHP Limits: What Employers and Employees Should Do Now

> The IRS raised 2026 HSA contribution caps and updated HDHP and excepted-benefit HRA thresholds; here’s what changed and how to prepare before open enrollment.

**Quick Update: 2026 HSA and HDHP Numbers Are In**

The IRS has released the annual inflation adjustments for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and their companion high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) for calendar year 2026. For 2026, HSA contribution limits rise to $4,400 for self-only coverage and $8,750 for family coverage, while qualifying HDHPs must have minimum deductibles of $1,700 (self-only) and $3,400 (family). Out-of-pocket maximums are capped at $8,500 (self-only) and $17,000 (family), and the maximum employer contribution for an excepted-benefit HRA is $2,200 for 2026 [1]. These thresholds shape what plans qualify as HSA-compatible and how much workers can save tax-advantaged for health costs each year [1].

Employers should update plan documents, payroll elections, and employee communications in time for open enrollment so that employees can take full advantage of the new limits and plans remain compliant with HSA eligibility rules [2].


**2026 At a Glance**

- HSA contribution caps: $4,400 (self-only); $8,750 (family) [1]
- HDHP minimum deductibles: $1,700 (self-only); $3,400 (family) [1]
- HDHP out-of-pocket (OOP) maximums: $8,500 (self-only); $17,000 (family) [1]
- Excepted-benefit HRA maximum: $2,200 [1]
- Age 55+ HSA catch-up contribution: $1,000 (unchanged) [2]

All figures apply for calendar year 2026; the HSA contribution limits and HDHP thresholds are indexed annually for inflation under the Internal Revenue Code and restated by the IRS each year [1].


**Why These Numbers Matter**

HSAs pair with HDHPs to give employees a tax-advantaged way to pay for medical expenses. Contributions are not taxed at the federal level, growth can be tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are not taxed—often described as a “triple tax advantage” under federal rules [2]. To contribute to an HSA, an individual must be covered by an HSA-qualified HDHP and have no disqualifying other coverage [1]. That makes the IRS’s annual adjustments significant: they define which plans qualify and how much employees and families can set aside each year [1].

The IRS also sets parameters for excepted-benefit HRAs (EBHRAs)—limited, stand-alone HRAs that can reimburse certain benefits like vision and dental or premiums for short-term, limited-duration insurance—by capping the annual employer contribution. For 2026, that cap is $2,200 [1].


**What Qualifies as an HDHP in 2026**

For 2026, an HDHP must meet both of these tests to be HSA-compatible [1]:

- Minimum annual deductible: at least $1,700 for self-only coverage or $3,400 for family coverage [1]
- Maximum out-of-pocket: no more than $8,500 for self-only coverage or $17,000 for family coverage [1]

The out-of-pocket maximum includes deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and other amounts the participant is required to pay under the plan, but it does not include premiums [1]. This distinction matters: premiums don’t count toward the OOP cap, but cost-sharing (like copays and coinsurance) does [1].

Note that “family” coverage in this context typically means any tier other than self-only (e.g., employee + spouse, employee + child(ren), employee + family), and the family thresholds apply for HSA/HDHP purposes [1]. Plans must be designed and administered to meet both the deductible and OOP thresholds for 2026 in order to maintain HSA eligibility for participants [1].


**The 2026 HSA Contribution Limits**

- Self-only: $4,400 [1]
- Family: $8,750 [1]
- Catch-up contribution (55+): $1,000, unchanged because the statute sets this amount and it is not indexed for inflation [2]

HSA contribution limits are annual totals across all sources—employee, employer, and others. If an employer contributes, those dollars count toward the annual cap. Employees who expect an employer contribution should plan their payroll elections accordingly so they don’t exceed the limit [1].

In most cases, HSA contribution eligibility follows the calendar year. The new limits apply to contributions for 2026, and contributions can typically be made up to the tax filing deadline for that tax year [1]. If you switch coverage midyear or change from self-only to family, contribution rules can be more complex; employees should confirm eligibility timing and amounts with their plan administrator or tax advisor [2].


**Excepted-Benefit HRA: 2026 Max Is $2,200**

Some employers offer an excepted-benefit HRA alongside a traditional health plan (or in limited contexts) to reimburse certain costs. For 2026, the maximum employer contribution to an EBHRA is $2,200 [1]. EBHRAs have specific regulatory conditions to qualify as “excepted benefits,” and they’re different from integrated HRAs that sit under a major medical plan or from individual coverage HRAs (ICHRAs). Employers using EBHRAs should confirm plan design features align with federal rules and the 2026 cap [1].


**What Changed—and What Didn’t**

- HSA caps increased modestly to $4,400 and $8,750, reflecting annual inflation adjustments [1].
- HDHP minimum deductibles and OOP maximums also adjusted upward to $1,700/$3,400 and $8,500/$17,000, respectively [1].
- The age 55+ HSA catch-up amount remains $1,000; this figure is fixed by statute and does not change with inflation [2].
- The EBHRA cap rose to $2,200 for 2026 [1].

If your 2026 medical plan designs were built around earlier estimates, ensure the final deductible and OOP maximum values meet the exact IRS thresholds so that HSA eligibility isn’t inadvertently lost [1].


**Action Steps for Employers Before Open Enrollment**

- Update plan documents and SPD/SMM: Confirm your 2026 HDHP plan options meet the new minimum deductible and OOP maximum standards, and that any EBHRA offered is capped at $2,200 [1].
- Coordinate with carriers and TPAs: Validate system configuration for the 2026 OOP maximum and cost-sharing accumulators; confirm all plan documents and SBCs reflect the new limits [1].
- Adjust payroll systems and election forms: Set 2026 HSA contribution elections to the new caps for self-only and family, and ensure the age 55+ catch-up option is available and properly labeled [1][2].
- Refresh employee communications: Explain the new limits, remind employees of the tax advantages of HSAs, and outline how to change elections during open enrollment [2].
- Review comparability and nondiscrimination: If you contribute to HSAs, review comparability rules (for employer-only contributions) or Section 125 nondiscrimination (for cafeteria plan elections) to avoid compliance issues [2].
- Revisit plan design strategy: Consider whether to adjust plan contributions or seed HSAs to encourage adoption of HDHPs while maintaining affordability under the new 2026 thresholds [2].

These steps help ensure employees can fully utilize the 2026 limits and that plan designs maintain HSA eligibility throughout the plan year [1][2].


**Employee Checklists: How to Use the New Limits**

- Verify HSA eligibility: To contribute, you must be enrolled in an HSA-qualified HDHP and not have disqualifying other coverage (such as a general-purpose FSA that pays before the deductible). Confirm your 2026 plan is HSA-compatible [1].
- Set your 2026 election: If you’re self-only, you can contribute up to $4,400; if you have family coverage, up to $8,750. If you are 55 or older in 2026, you can add $1,000 as a catch-up [1][2].
- Coordinate with employer contributions: Employer HSA contributions count toward the annual maximum; factor them in when setting your own payroll deductions [1].
- Focus on OOP risk: The maximum you could pay in-network for covered services (deductible + copays/coinsurance) is $8,500 self-only or $17,000 family in 2026, not including premiums [1]. Choose a contribution level that cushions that risk.
- Review dependents and family tiers: If you cover any dependents, the family limits apply for HSA and HDHP thresholds in 2026 [1].
- Keep receipts: Qualified withdrawals from HSAs are tax-free when used for eligible medical expenses; documentation matters for tax records [2].


**Plan Design Pitfalls to Avoid**

- Deductible misalignment: A self-only deductible below $1,700 or a family deductible below $3,400 would disqualify the plan as an HDHP for 2026 [1]. Ensure plan design doesn’t dip under the threshold for any tier.
- OOP maximum mis-set: If OOP maximums exceed $8,500 self-only or $17,000 family, the plan falls out of HSA eligibility for 2026 [1]. Double-check accumulator configurations with carriers and TPAs.
- Other coverage conflicts: General-purpose HRAs or FSAs that pay pre-deductible can disqualify HSA contributions. Employers commonly offer “limited-purpose” (dental/vision) or post-deductible FSAs/HRAs for HDHP participants; ensure your 2026 offerings preserve HSA eligibility for those who want it [2].
- Communication gaps: Employees often assume last year’s HSA election will cover this year’s expenses. Remind them of the new limits, the catch-up rules for those 55+, and how to adjust contributions at open enrollment [2].


**Compliance and Documentation**

- Cafeteria plan amendments: If employees make HSA contributions through a Section 125 cafeteria plan, confirm your plan document allows the updated 2026 limits and catch-up elections [2].
- Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC): Make sure SBCs reflect the correct 2026 deductibles and OOP maximums so employees can compare plans accurately [1].
- EBHRA notices: If offering EBHRAs, ensure the maximum employer contribution is clearly stated as $2,200 for 2026 and that the plan operates within federal conditions for excepted benefits [1].

Proactive, clear documentation reduces downstream corrections and employee confusion, especially where HSA eligibility depends on the exact plan design meeting IRS thresholds [1].


**Budgeting and Cost-Sharing Strategy**

For employers, the 2026 increases present a chance to reassess plan value and cost-sharing:

- Contribution strategy: Modest increases in employer HSA contributions can encourage adoption of HDHP options while offsetting higher deductibles. Communicate the total value (premium savings + HSA seeding) so employees understand net cost [2].
- OOP exposure: The 2026 OOP caps indicate the financial risk ceiling for members. Benefits teams may want to illustrate “worst-case” vs. “expected” costs in decision support tools to help employees select the right plan and HSA contribution level [1].
- EBHRA use cases: The 2026 EBHRA cap of $2,200 may be useful for employers that want to support limited benefits like dental/vision or certain short-term coverage without altering the core medical plan [1].

These moves can make high-deductible plans more predictable and manageable for employees navigating rising health costs [2].


**Employee Education: The Case for HSAs**

For employees who are eligible and can budget for it, HSAs can be powerful tools:

- Federal tax advantages: Contributions can be pre-tax via payroll or tax-deductible if made directly; growth is tax-deferred; withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free [2].
- Portability and rollover: HSA funds are owned by the individual and remain available year-to-year, even if you change jobs or health plans, as long as withdrawals are for qualified medical expenses [2].
- Investing for future care: Many providers allow investing HSA balances above a minimum threshold. This can help build a reserve for later-life health costs, though it introduces investment risk [2].

Remind employees that HSAs are for medical spending at any age, but after age 65 non-medical withdrawals are taxed like ordinary income (and before 65, non-qualified withdrawals are generally taxed and penalized). Understanding the trade-offs helps employees plan appropriately [2].


**State Taxes: One More Variable**

Federal rules govern eligibility and federal tax treatment, but state income tax treatment of HSAs is not uniform. A few states tax HSA contributions and/or earnings differently than federal law. Employers with multi-state workforces and employees who move between states should confirm state treatment when planning contributions and communicating tax impacts [3].

This variability doesn’t change federal limits or eligibility, but it can affect an employee’s after-tax benefit depending on where they live or file taxes [3].


**What If You’re Not on an HDHP?**

Only individuals enrolled in an HSA-qualified HDHP and without disqualifying other coverage can make or receive HSA contributions for 2026 [1]. If you enroll in a non-HDHP plan option, you won’t be eligible to contribute for months you are not HSA-eligible. Employees who prefer non-HDHP options might still use other accounts (e.g., general-purpose FSAs if offered), but those accounts operate under different rules and don’t share the same federal tax treatment as HSAs [2].

If your long-term goal is to use an HSA, consider whether an HDHP plan with appropriate HSA contributions (your own plus any employer seed) fits your expected medical needs and budget for 2026 [2].


**Timing and Next Steps**

- Calendar-year plans: These changes apply for the 2026 calendar year; employees will typically set their HSA payroll elections during the 2026 open enrollment cycle for contributions starting in January 2026 [1].
- Off-cycle or fiscal-year plans: HSA contribution limits are always calendar-year caps, even if your medical plan renews midyear; confirm your communication explains how the annual cap applies in practice [1].
- Midyear coverage changes: If you change between self-only and family coverage during 2026, your maximum HSA contribution for the year may need to be prorated or determined under special rules. Employees should review their specific situation with HR or a tax advisor to stay within the cap [2].

Ensuring clarity on these timing rules helps employees avoid excess contributions and potential corrective distributions [2].


**Trade-Offs to Keep in Mind**

- Higher deductible exposure: HDHPs require members to pay more up front before the plan pays most services, which can be challenging for those with frequent care needs. However, premiums are often lower and HSAs can offset costs—especially with employer contributions [2].
- OOP ceilings and budgeting: The 2026 OOP caps define worst-case in-network exposure, excluding premiums. Employees should plan HSA contributions with these ceilings in mind [1].
- Taxes and investment risk: HSAs can be invested and grow tax-deferred, but market risk applies. Employees nearing retirement or with short-term spending needs may prefer keeping balances in cash-like options [2].

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer; the right plan depends on expected health usage, financial cushion, and risk tolerance [2].


**Bottom Line**

For 2026, the IRS set HSA contribution limits at $4,400 for self-only and $8,750 for family coverage, raised HDHP minimum deductibles to $1,700 and $3,400, capped HDHP out-of-pocket maximums at $8,500 and $17,000, and set the EBHRA maximum at $2,200 [1]. The 55+ catch-up remains $1,000 [2].

Employers should move now—update plan documents, coordinate with carriers and payroll vendors, and prepare clear communications—so employees can make informed choices during open enrollment and capture the full value of HSAs under the 2026 rules [1][2]. For employees, verify your HSA eligibility, set your 2026 election, and plan contributions with your expected care and the OOP caps in mind. State tax treatment may vary, so consider your state when assessing the after-tax benefits [3].

With timely preparation, both employers and employees can maximize the advantages of HSAs and ensure HDHPs remain compliant under the updated 2026 thresholds [1][2].
