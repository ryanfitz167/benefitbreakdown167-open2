# Small-Group Filings Preview the 2026 Sticker Shock

> Early filings point to a median ~11% small-group premium jump for 2026, driven by 2024 claims experience, higher utilization, specialty drugs, and hospital price growth.

**The quick take**

Early state rate filings for ACA-compliant small-group plans point to a tough 2026 renewal season. Across 318 filings reviewed so far, the median proposed increase is roughly 11%, with many carriers clustered in the 5%–15% range and a notable slice over 20% [1]. Filings frequently cite 2024 experience—higher utilization, specialty drugs, and hospital price hikes—as the core reasons behind the requested increases [1]. In at least one state summary (Virginia), carriers point to 2024 loss ratios around 99%, feeding into their 2026 projections and underscoring thin margins on recent business [2].

Proposed is not final. State regulators will review the requests and can push back on assumptions or trim increases before approvals are locked in [6]. Still, the early signals are consistent: employers should prepare for pressure and engage carriers and brokers now to separate the drivers they can influence from those they cannot.

**What the filings are saying**

- Median proposed increase near 11% across 318 small-group filings, with most requests in a 5%–15% band and a subset over 20% [1].
- Common stated drivers: elevated 2024 utilization, specialty pharmacy spend, and hospital price escalation [1].
- Example state summaries show 2024 loss ratios near 99% for some carriers, suggesting minimal room for administrative costs and margin and contributing to higher 2026 asks [2].

Context helps: while the ACA requires small-group insurers to spend at least 80% of premium dollars on medical claims and quality improvement (the medical loss ratio rule), a loss ratio near the high 90s indicates carriers paid out almost all premiums in claims during that experience period, leaving little to no cushion for administration or profit [3].

Make a habit of noting where each line points on the total request. For example, 6 points from hospital unit cost, 3 points from utilization, 2 points from specialty pharmacy—this helps you focus negotiations on the biggest levers, not the smallest.

**Unit cost vs. utilization: separate the levers**

Carriers generally present trend as price times quantity. This is where your negotiation strategy and plan design options come into focus:

- Unit cost (prices). Commercial prices paid to hospitals and clinicians are a primary driver of spending growth in the U.S. overall [4]. Markets with higher underlying hospital prices typically face more pressure in premium trend.
- Utilization (volume and mix). Increases in outpatient procedures, diagnostic imaging, and post-acute services can raise per-member per-year claims, even if prices stayed flat. Utilization can also reflect shifts to higher-intensity settings.
- Pharmacy—especially specialty. High-cost specialty drugs continue to drive pharmacy trend and are frequently cited in filings as a top contributor to 2026 requests [1].

When you see a double-digit proposed increase, insist on a plain-English breakout of how many points come from prices, how many from volumes, and how many from pharmacy. Then decide which levers are feasible for your workforce.

**Why rates vary by state and carrier**

Premium trends are hyperlocal. Differences in hospital and physician prices across regions—and even across networks in the same city—can be stark, which helps explain why two carriers can file very different requests for similar small-group products [5]. Regulatory review practices also differ among states; some departments regularly modify or reduce proposed increases, while others approve most requests as filed [6]. That means your result depends not only on carrier experience but also on where you buy coverage and who reviews the filing.

**Where employers can push—and what to expect in return**

You cannot rewrite a carrier’s statewide filing, but you can influence your own renewal. Consider these targeted asks:

- Ask for a trend decomposition. Require a side-by-side of the 2026 request: unit cost, utilization, and pharmacy shares. Push for documentation on the largest line items, not just an aggregate percentage [1].
- Shop networks, not just logos. Where viable, request quotes on broad, tiered, and narrow networks. In markets with wide hospital price variation, network selection can materially change unit cost exposure [5]. Trade-off: narrow networks can reduce choice and could impact access for certain employees.
- Pharmacy management. Ask about specialty drug strategies: site-of-care redirection, prior authorization, step therapy, and biosimilar adoption. Make sure plan design aligns with the formulary. Trade-off: tighter controls can increase member friction.
- Benefit calibration. Consider plan designs that encourage high-value care settings (e.g., ambulatory surgery centers vs. hospital outpatient departments) while preserving access to necessary services. Trade-off: design complexity and communications burden.
- Data and reporting. Request quarterly utilization and high-cost claimant reporting to catch adverse trends earlier. Trade-off: more reporting can require more HR time to act on insights.
- Funding strategy check. If you are exploring level-funded or self-funded options, scrutinize stop-loss terms and variability in monthly costs. Trade-off: potential savings come with greater volatility and responsibility.

The goal is not to eliminate trend—it is to target the largest, controllable drivers in your market and workforce while maintaining a competitive benefit.

**Reading the fine print: practical memo checkpoints**

- Base claims period and any COVID-19 or one-time adjustments. Are they excluding anomalies or smoothing large claims in a reasonable way?
- Specialty drug pipeline assumptions. Are they projecting new therapies that could materially change 2026 spend? If so, what mitigation tactics are assumed?
- Hospital contract renewals. If a major system contract is renewed in late 2025, does the memo assume a specific price change? How sensitive is the filed trend to that renewal?
- Changes in provider billing patterns. Are site-of-care shifts (e.g., hospital outpatient departments billing facility fees) included in the utilization or the unit-cost assumption?
- Non-benefit load transparency. Commissions, admin, taxes, and fees should be clearly broken out. Cross-check that the overall load is consistent with MLR requirements for small group [3].

Use your broker or consultant to benchmark these items across carriers—outlier assumptions are negotiable.

**The role of regulators—and why proposed ≠ approved**

Under the ACA’s rate-review program, state or federal regulators examine proposed increases for reasonableness and can require revisions, additional justification, or reductions, especially for increases that exceed federal review thresholds [6]. That oversight does not eliminate upward pressure from 2024 experience, but it often moderates extreme requests. Employers should track both filings and final approvals for their specific plans, since approved rates can diverge meaningfully from initial asks [6].

**Bottom line for 2026 planning**

- Expect upward pressure. Early filings point to a median ~11% requested increase in small-group premiums for 2026, with many in the 5%–15% band and a slice over 20% [1].
- Know your drivers. Filings emphasize 2024 utilization, specialty drugs, and hospital prices—ask carriers to quantify each driver for your plan [1].
- Use the memo as a roadmap. Separate unit cost, utilization, and pharmacy. Target the biggest, controllable line items.
- Mind local realities. Network prices and regulatory review vary by state and carrier, influencing both requests and approvals [5][6].
- Negotiate deliberately. Network selection, pharmacy management, and benefit calibration are the most common employer levers—each has trade-offs.

If there is a single action item: request a plain-English decomposition of your renewal—how many points from prices, how many from utilization, how many from pharmacy—and make every other decision in that context.
