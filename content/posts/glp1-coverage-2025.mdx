**Context:** GLP-1 medications for diabetes and weight management remain the pharmacy story to watch. Here’s what to know.

## Coverage Patterns

- **Diabetes:** Widely covered, often with prior authorization and step therapy.
- **Obesity/weight management:** Coverage varies; many plans require clinical criteria and a lifestyle program.

## What Employers Are Doing

- Setting **clear clinical criteria** and periodic re-evaluation.  
- Pairing with **care management** (nutrition, behavioral health, activity).  
- Exploring **value-based contracts** and center-of-excellence models.

## Member Experience Considerations

- Transparent expectations: side effects, dose titration, follow-ups.  
- Support for adherence and coverage changes.  
- Coordination with PCP/endocrinology to avoid fragmentation.

## What to Do This Quarter

1. Review Rx policy language and member communications.  
2. Confirm prior-auth criteria and appeals timelines with your PBM/carrier.  
3. Stand up a simple **“Am I covered?”** explainer page members can read in under 60 seconds.

*Takeaway:* Balance access and stewardship—**clear rules, real coaching, measured outcomes**.
