# Stop-Loss and Million-Dollar Claims: How Self-Funded Shock Drives Fully Insured Pricing

> Stop-loss premiums are climbing amid a surge in multi-million-dollar claims, and the ripple effects are showing up in fully insured rates, too.

**The headline trend: costs up, severity up**
Stop-loss premiums rose roughly 9–10% year over year across common deductible bands in the latest 2025 Aegis survey—an acceleration that tracks with continued growth in catastrophic claims severity and frequency [1]. Industry market data underscores the point: claims of $2 million or more have risen approximately 1,251% since 2013, a stark signal that outsized losses are no longer edge cases but recurring events that shape how carriers price risk [2]. Those same severity dynamics are informing 2026 rating assumptions across the ecosystem, with reinsurers and stop-loss markets building in higher trend and more conservative shock-claim allowances [2][3].

Why it matters beyond self-funded plans: fully insured groups ultimately pay for upstream risk through pooled charges, reinsurer pricing, and tighter underwriting guardrails, even when their own claims are relatively stable in a given year [3].

**Why even fully insured groups feel it**
Fully insured carriers use reinsurance and internal pooling to smooth volatility from catastrophic claims. When a plan hits the pooling point (the carrier-defined threshold where extremely large claims are carved out of a group’s experience and blended into a broader pool), the cost of that pooled risk is financed through premium—either as an explicit pooling charge or embedded in overall rates [3]. Reinsurer prices for catastrophic risk have moved upward alongside the stop-loss market, raising insurers’ cost of capital for severity, which trickles down to fully insured pricing, especially in rating periods following high-severity years [3].

Even when an employer is not self-funded, the macro reality of million-dollar claims—often linked to advanced specialty drugs, complex transplants, or novel gene therapies—pushes the entire market’s severity allowance higher. Carriers responding to these exposures may also tighten coverage terms, revise claim adjudication protocols, and recalibrate risk models—changes that can flow into the fully insured book in the form of higher trend assumptions or stricter benefit management programs [3][4].

**The mechanics: how stop-loss manages shock claims**
Self-funded employers typically pair their plan with two coverages: specific stop-loss (protecting against very large claims for an individual member) and aggregate stop-loss (protecting against unusually high total claims for the group). Underwriting tools have grown sharper as severity has climbed:
- Lasers: A “laser” sets a higher specific deductible for a known high-risk member. It isolates that risk for pricing, often keeping the overall rate lower but exposing the employer to more first-dollar risk on that individual [6].
- No-new-laser and renewal rate caps: Employers often negotiate provisions that limit the carrier’s ability to add new lasers or cap renewal increases—trading some near-term predictability for potentially higher base rates [6].
- Aggregating specific (agg-spec): An additional threshold that must be met, in aggregate, before specific stop-loss begins paying—functioning like a corridor above the plan’s per-member deductibles and below the stop-loss attachment. It can reduce premiums but increases the employer’s volatility in a bad year [10].

These levers redistribute who bears which layer of catastrophic risk and at what price. As million-dollar claims become more common, underwriting often leans toward tighter terms, higher deductibles, and higher premiums to keep the risk-bearing capital sustainable [1][2].

**What’s driving severity: a few claims dominate the spend**
A small number of claims account for a large share of costs, with high-acuity conditions (e.g., cancers, neonatal complications), complex transplants, and specialty drugs leading the list [4]. Sun Life’s latest high-cost claims report highlights the continued growth in seven-figure claims and the expanding role of high-cost injectable therapies, which now frequently account for a large fraction of catastrophic cases when combined with hospitalization and complications [4].

Gene therapies exemplify the new severity frontier. One-time treatments can carry list prices in the seven figures, and even when utilization is rare, the budget impact for a small or mid-sized employer can be destabilizing. This profile has prompted new financial protection and risk-segmentation products in the stop-loss market [4][8]. Meanwhile, solid-organ and stem cell transplants remain perennial cost drivers due to hospital charges, complications, re-admissions, and long-term drug regimens; specialized networks and transplant programs exist precisely to control quality and unit price for these episodes [4][7].

On the pharmacy side, GLP-1 medications for diabetes and obesity are a top trend driver. While they can yield important health benefits, they also introduce sustained, high monthly costs at rising utilization levels—an affordability challenge that has pushed payers and stop-loss carriers to experiment with risk corridors and outcome-based constructs for this class [2][9].

**Carving out the outliers: what carriers are doing**
To cope with unbounded severity and fast-evolving therapies, carriers and employers are deploying more targeted risk segmentation:
- Transplant carve-outs and centers of excellence: Directing candidates to contracted centers with bundled rates and proven outcomes aims to lower variation, reduce complications, and stabilize unit costs [7]. Carriers may offer transplant-specific arrangements that sit alongside stop-loss to protect against catastrophic episodes [7].
- Gene therapy financial protection: Some stop-loss carriers and reinsurers offer add-on coverage or “carve-out” solutions, ring-fencing known therapies with pre-negotiated terms, prior-authorization pathways, and separate funding mechanics to smooth the shock of a single seven-figure claim [8].
- GLP-1 risk corridors: Brokers and stop-loss markets report corridor structures that share downside if utilization or spend exceeds targets, while allowing employers to access broader coverage if they commit to adherence programs and clinical criteria. These are evolving quickly and can materially affect a plan’s net cost if the contract is carefully aligned with benefit rules and PBM terms [2][9].

The trade-off: carve-outs and corridors can lower volatility and improve predictability, but they add vendor complexity, customize benefit language, and sometimes force members into narrower pathways. Due diligence on scope, exclusions, and how these arrangements coordinate with the base stop-loss contract is essential [2][7][8].

**State lines matter: stop-loss rules vary**
State regulation of stop-loss can influence minimum specific deductibles, availability for small groups, and how aggressively carriers can use lasers. The NAIC Stop-Loss Insurance Model Act establishes a framework, including minimum attachment points and small-group protections that many states reference when crafting their own rules [5]. States vary in whether and how they restrict stop-loss for small employers and in the minimum levels at which specific and aggregate coverage may attach—a factor that can materially change pricing and employer risk [6]. In tight markets, these rules can limit the levers available to underwriters and to employers shopping for alternatives [5][6].

Bottom line: geography and group size can tilt the playing field for tactics like lasers, agg-spec, and small-group access to stop-loss. Employers should align broker strategy with state constraints before renewal negotiations begin [5][6].

**Negotiating in a severity-driven market**
As you look to 2026, consider practical steps that acknowledge the severity drumbeat while defending budget predictability:
- Get an early read: Ask for preliminary quotes and alternates across deductibles, with and without agg-spec. Model worst-case cash flow, not just premiums [1][10].
- Press on lasers and caps: Seek no-new-laser provisions or reasonable renewal caps. Price the trade explicitly: what’s the premium delta versus a laser-permitted quote? [6]
- Align pharmacy and stop-loss: If exploring a GLP-1 risk corridor, make sure formulary, prior authorization, and adherence rules are consistent across your PBM and stop-loss endorsements. Clarify who measures outcomes and how credits are calculated [2][9].
- Evaluate carve-outs carefully: For transplants and gene therapies, map every step—clinical pathway, network steerage, prior auth, payment mechanics, and interaction with your base stop-loss. Confirm how experimental vs. covered indications are treated [7][8].
- Use centers of excellence and case management: Tighten referral pathways for high-cost episodes and connect members early to programs that reduce avoidable complications [4][7].
- Anticipate pooling charges (fully insured): If you are fully insured, ask your carrier or consultant how pooling thresholds and reinsurer pricing influenced your rate build and whether alternative benefit management programs could mitigate trend [3].

**What to watch next**
- Pipeline risk: Expect a trickle of new cell and gene therapies, and more targeted oncology agents with high launch prices. Stop-loss endorsements that define which therapies are in-scope will matter more, not less [4][8].
- Specialty trend vs. utilization management: GLP-1 coverage policies will keep evolving. Risk-sharing constructs may become more standardized, but details around member eligibility, discontinuation rules, and real-world effectiveness will decide who benefits financially [2][9].
- Capacity and capital: If reinsurer capital tightens or loss ratios run hot, underwriters may push attachment points higher, widen corridors, or add exclusions—affecting both self-funded and fully insured pricing posture in 2026 [2][3].

**The takeaway**
Stop-loss rates are rising in step with a supercharged tail of catastrophic claims, and the consequences are not contained to self-funded plans. Fully insured groups pay through pooling and reinsurance, while employers of all types face more complex contracts aimed at isolating truly catastrophic risk. Understanding lasers, aggregating specific, and targeted carve-outs—plus how GLP-1 risk corridors and specialty pipelines are changing the math—will help you navigate 2026 pricing with fewer surprises and better control over volatility [1][2][3][4][9][10].
