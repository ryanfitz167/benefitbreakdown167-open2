**Why this matters:** If you understand these two terms, you’ll understand 80% of how your plan costs work.

## Deductible

The **deductible** is what you pay for covered services *before* your plan starts sharing costs. Example: a \$1,500 deductible means you pay the first \$1,500 of allowed charges each year.

## Out-of-Pocket Maximum (OOP Max)

Your **OOP Max** is a ceiling on what *you* pay in a plan year for covered in-network services (deductibles, copays, coinsurance). After you hit it, the plan pays **100%** of covered costs for the rest of the year.

## How They Interact

- You usually pay the deductible first, then coinsurance (e.g., 20%).
- Those amounts accumulate toward the OOP Max.
- Copays may or may not count toward the deductible but typically count toward the OOP Max.

## Common Scenarios

### Primary Care Visit
Copay plan: you pay a fixed copay (e.g., \$25). HDHP: the visit may apply to your deductible, then coinsurance.

### Imaging or Surgery
These are higher-cost. On an HDHP, you’ll likely meet your deductible quickly, then pay coinsurance until the OOP Max.

### Prescriptions
Plans differ: some use tiered copays, others apply Rx to the deductible first, especially on HDHPs.

## Tips to Pay Less

- **Stay in-network:** Lower allowed charges, applies to OOP caps.  
- **Use preventive care:** Usually covered at 100% in-network.  
- **Price shop:** Use your plan’s comparison tool for imaging, labs, elective procedures.

*Bottom line:* The deductible starts the meter; the OOP Max stops it.
